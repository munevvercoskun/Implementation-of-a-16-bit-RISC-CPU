# Implementation-of-a-16-bit-RISC-CPU

The main topics of the project include basic architecture of modern computers, interaction between computer hardware and software at various levels, and performance evaluation and metrics. Instruction set design and computer arithmetic are also discussed. Data path and control unit design for RISC Processors are covered in detail. The work includes **_the design and implementation of a 16-bit RISC CPU using an FPGA development system and VHDL._**

**_At the end, I was able to;_**

+ Combine engineering principles pertaining to instruction set architecture, register transfer, interconnections (e.g., buses, 3-state buffers, and Muxes), and control hardware to craft various processor designs. Utilize specialized knowledge of subsystems such as data paths, memory, and control units in creating a RISC processing element.

+ Establish clear definitions for processor specifications and instruction set architecture. Tackle the multifaceted challenges of designing high-performance RISC processors through a multi-stage process. Employ VHDL-based computer-aided design (CAD) modeling and simulation techniques to rigorously examine and validate each stage of processor development. Finally, seamlessly integrate these stages to create an efficient processor architecture.

+ In the demonstration and oral sessions, showcase the key aspects of all the laboratory exercises and respond to inquiries related to CPU design. Prepare lab and CPU design reports adhering to a standardized format reminiscent of IEEE guidelines, with assessments based on completeness, language proficiency, and relevance of content.
